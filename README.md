# Vizualizing protein interactions

Analyze raw FASTQ files from a paired-end Illumina NGS dataset output using AlphaSeq technology. Extract barcodes (unique to each protein ID) from the 5' end of reads. Paired barcodes reflect protein binding affinity between recombinant proteins expressed on the surface of MATa and MATalpha yeast strains, with higher values indicating a higher number of protein-protein interactions. Vizualize the resulting protein-protein interactions as a heatmap and a Sankey diagram.
