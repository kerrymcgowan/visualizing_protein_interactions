# Vizualizing protein interactions

Analyze raw FASTQ files from a paired-end Illumina NGS dataset generated using AlphaSeq technology.

Extract barcodes (unique to each protein ID) from the 5' end of reads. Barcode pairs reflect protein binding affinities between recombinant proteins expressed on the surface of MATa and MATalpha yeast strains, with higher values indicating a higher number of protein-protein interactions. Protein-protein interactions were visualized as a heatmap and a Sankey diagram.
